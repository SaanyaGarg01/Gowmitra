            <h2>Proper Feeding Management for Cattle</h2>
            <p>
                Feeding is one of the most crucial aspects of cattle management. A well-balanced diet ensures better milk production and overall cattle health.
                Cows require a mix of green fodder, dry fodder, and mineral supplements to maintain their productivity. Farmers must ensure that cows have access to clean drinking water at all times, as dehydration can lead to a decline in milk yield.
                <br><br>
                Proper feeding includes providing high-energy feed during lactation, protein-rich diets for growth, and fibrous materials to aid digestion. Good quality roughage is essential to maintain a healthy rumen function. Mineral blocks should be kept in the cowshed to supplement essential nutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, and salt.
                <br><br>
                Additionally, seasonal variations in feed must be considered. During summers, feeding strategies should include high moisture content feed, while in winters, more energy-dense food should be provided. Farmers should also avoid contaminated or moldy fodder as it can lead to severe health problems.

            <h2>Ways to Improve Milk Quality</h2>
            <p>
                The quality of milk produced depends significantly on the health and nutrition of the cow. Proper hygiene, timely vaccinations, and balanced nutrition play a key role in maintaining milk quality.
                <br><br>
                To prevent contamination, cows should be milked in a clean environment. The udders must be washed with warm water and dried before milking. The use of antibiotics should be minimized, as excessive antibiotic residues in milk can be harmful to consumers.
                <br><br>
                Good milk production also depends on stress-free cows. Cattle should not be subjected to extreme heat or cold. Shade and cooling systems should be provided in summer, and warm bedding in winter. Proper care during the dry period (when the cow is not producing milk) is essential to ensure a successful next lactation cycle.
                <br><br>
                Farmers should also focus on genetic selection for better milk quality. Breeding high-yielding cows with proven genetics can significantly improve milk production and quality over generations.

            <h2>Essential Cattle Care Practices</h2>
            <p>
                Cattle health is a major factor that determines farm productivity. Proper vaccination, disease prevention, and overall cattle care must be a priority for every farmer.
                <br><br>
                Regular checkups by a veterinarian help detect illnesses early. Common diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, mastitis, and brucellosis can be prevented through proper vaccination and hygiene practices.
                <br><br>
                Clean and dry housing conditions are crucial for preventing infections. Cow sheds should be well-ventilated, and bedding must be changed regularly to avoid bacterial growth. Overcrowding should be avoided as it can cause stress and increase disease transmission.
                <br><br>
                Hoof care is also essential, as improper foot health can lead to lameness. Farmers should ensure that cattle hooves are trimmed regularly and that cows do not stand in wet or muddy conditions for long periods.
                <br><br>
                Stress management is another key factor. Farmers should ensure that cows have sufficient rest and are not exposed to harsh conditions. Good handling practices can reduce fear and anxiety in cattle, leading to better overall health and milk production.
